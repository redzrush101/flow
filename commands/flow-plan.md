You are executing the `/flow-plan` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive project plan with phases, tasks, and iterations.

**🟢 NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED**

**Updates**:
- `PLAN.md` - Project overview, goals, scope, architecture
- `DASHBOARD.md` - Progress tracking with all phases/tasks

**Process**:
1. Analyze current project state from DASHBOARD.md
2. Define clear project phases and milestones
3. Break down into specific tasks with iterations
4. Establish architecture and technical decisions

**Example**: `/flow-plan build-rest-api`

Next steps:
1. Review updated PLAN.md
2. Use `/flow-phase` to begin first phase
3. Use `/flow-task` to start specific tasks

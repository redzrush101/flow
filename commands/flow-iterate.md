description: Work through task iterations with brainstorming and implementation
---

You are executing the `/flow-iterate` command from the Flow framework.

**Purpose**: Manage iterations within tasks (brainstorm → implement → complete).

**🟢 NO FRAMEWORK READING REQUIRED**

**Process**:
1. Add iteration: `/flow-iterate add <description>`
2. Start brainstorming: `/flow-iterate brainstorm`
3. Begin implementation: `/flow-iterate implement`
4. Complete iteration: `/flow-iterate complete`

**Updates**:
- `phase-N/task-N.md` - Iteration details and progress
- `DASHBOARD.md` - Current iteration tracking

**Examples**:
- `/flow-iterate add "Basic validation logic"`
- `/flow-iterate brainstorm`
- `/flow-iterate implement`
- `/flow-iterate complete`

Next steps:
1. Use `/flow-brainstorm` for detailed brainstorming
2. Use `/flow-implement` for focused implementation
3. Use `/flow-status` to track progress
